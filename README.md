## Overview
The purpose of the project is to develop an understanding of user-centered design principles by prototyping and evaluating the home screen of a weather app. The project progresses through four key stages, culminating in an HTML/CSS prototype.

## Stages of the Project
### **1. Need-Finding**
- Conducted interviews with two users who regularly use weather apps.
- Identified key features users value, such as:
  - Clear display of current temperature and air quality.
  - Hourly forecasts with intuitive icons.
  - Daily comparisons for understanding trends.
- Synthesized user feedback into actionable design insights for the prototype.

### **2. Low-Fidelity Prototyping**
- Created three hand-drawn sketches exploring different layouts and ways to present weather data.
- Evaluated each design for clarity, usability, and adherence to user preferences.
- Combined the best aspects into a single refined design.

### **3. High-Fidelity Prototyping**
- Developed a polished paper prototype incorporating colors, iconography, and layout improvements.
- Aimed for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

### **4. HTML/CSS Prototype**
- Implemented the finalized design using HTML and CSS.
- The prototype is static but closely mirrors the ideal design.
- Added responsiveness to ensure the layout is optimized for a phone-sized browser window.
